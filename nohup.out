Caption:  Combined mucinous and invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST). The favourable prognosis associated with pure mucinous carcinoma is no longer expected when it is admixed with regular invasive carcinoma NST.
UUID: 75e3f334-8dfc-4bb8-be3e-7b4e5653b688

Question: What might the visual difference be between pure mucinous carcinoma and invasive carcinoma NST in the image?
Answer: Pure mucinous carcinoma is typically characterized by clusters of tumor cells floating in pools of mucin. In contrast, invasive carcinoma NST might appear as irregular growths that invade surrounding tissues, though the exact appearance may vary.

Question: Where in the image might we see the mucinous carcinoma admixed with the invasive carcinoma NST?
Answer: It may not be possible to differentiate the two visually without the use of staining techniques or microscopic examination. However, one might expect to see areas with characteristics of both types of carcinoma, potentially in close proximity or intertwined.

Question: What would be the visual indicators in the image that suggest the carcinoma is no longer just mucinous but also invasive?
Answer: Invasive carcinomas often present as irregular or poorly defined growths that invade into surrounding tissues. This might contrast with the more distinct areas of mucinous carcinoma, which are often encapsulated and filled with mucin.

Question: Where in the image would the invasive carcinoma NST be most likely to appear?
Answer: Invasive carcinoma NST typically invades the surrounding tissues, so it might be seen extending beyond the initial tumor boundaries and into adjacent areas.

Question: What visually distinctive features could suggest a favourable prognosis in the image?
Answer: This is tricky to answer without the specific context of the patient's overall health and the stage of the cancer, but typically, tumors that are smaller, well-defined, and not invading into surrounding tissues might be associated with a more favourable prognosis.

Caption:  Expression of estrogen receptor (ER) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A DCIS of low nuclear grade with diffuse, strong nuclear expression of ER. B DCIS of high nuclear grade lacking nuclear expression of ER. Adapted from {34}.
UUID: ca3dea3c-b55e-4416-a6ac-25cc7020c7ce

Question: What visual characteristics might suggest a high nuclear grade in the image?
Answer: High nuclear grade in ductal carcinoma in situ is often associated with irregularly shaped, enlarged nuclei in the cells, and a lack of expression of the estrogen receptor, which would be visible as a lack of staining in the nuclei of the cells.

Question: Where in the image might we be able to see the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)?
Answer: The expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) would typically be seen in the nuclei of the cells. In the case of a ductal carcinoma in situ of low nuclear grade, the expression would be diffuse and strong, which would be visible as extensive and intense staining in the nuclei.

Question: What might be the visual difference in the cells of ductal carcinoma in situ of low nuclear grade compared to high nuclear grade?
Answer: Cells of low nuclear grade ductal carcinoma in situ would typically show smaller, regular and uniform nuclei with a diffuse and strong expression of estrogen receptor (ER), which would be visible as staining in the nuclei. In contrast, cells of high nuclear grade would show larger, irregular nuclei and lack the staining indicating ER expression.

Question: Where in the image could we typically find the ductal carcinoma in situ?
Answer: The ductal carcinoma in situ would be found in the ducts of the breast tissue. The cells inside the ducts would show changes that indicate non-invasive cancer.

Question: What could the distribution of nuclear staining tell us about the image?
Answer: The distribution of nuclear staining could indicate the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). Diffuse, strong staining would suggest a high expression of ER, which is typically found in ductal carcinoma in situ of low nuclear grade. On the other hand, the absence of staining would suggest a lack of ER expression, which is typically seen in ductal carcinoma in situ of high nuclear grade.

Caption: . Celiac disease. The normal villi are blunted almost out of existence, with the duodenal mucosa resembling colon. There is chronic inflammation within the lamina propria (arrow). Inset: Increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes are present (arrowheads).
UUID: a81becf8-4039-48eb-9c04-a17d1b9579ff

Question: What might be the noticeable difference between a healthy duodenal mucosa and the one presented in the image?
Answer: In the image, the healthy villi typically seen in duodenal mucosa are greatly diminished. Instead, the mucosa might visually resemble that of the colon.

Question: Where could we expect to see chronic inflammation in this image?
Answer: The chronic inflammation would likely be observed within the lamina propria.

Question: What can be inferred about the state of the villi in the image?
Answer: From the image, one can infer that the villi in the duodenal mucosa are blunted or greatly reduced, a characteristic often associated with celiac disease.

Question: What changes in the intraepithelial lymphocytes might be visible in this image?
Answer: The image may show an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, indicating an immune response.

Question: Where in the image do you think the visual representation of the villi might be located?
Answer: The villi would be part of the duodenal mucosa, so they could be located in the area where we would expect to see the inner lining of the small intestine.
